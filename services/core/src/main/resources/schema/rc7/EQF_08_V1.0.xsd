			The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) acts as a translation device to make 
			national qualifications more readable across Europe, promoting workers' and learners' 
			mobility between countries and facilitating their lifelong learning. The core of the EQF 
			concerns eight reference levels describing what a learner knows, understands and 
			is able to do â€“ 'learning outcomes'. Levels range from basic (Level 1) to advanced (Level 8).
			The EQF applies to all types of education, training and qualifications, 
			from school education to academic, professional and vocational.

				Each of the 8 levels is defined by a set of descriptors indicating the learning outcomes 
				relevant to qualifications at that level in any system of qualifications.
				Knowledge: in the context of EQF, knowledge is described as theoretical and/or factual.
				Skills: in the context of EQF, skills are described as cognitive 
				        (involving the use of logical, intuitive and creative thinking) 
				        and practical (involving manual dexterity and the use of methods, materials, 
				        tools and instruments).
				Competence: In the context of EQF, competence is described in terms of responsibility and autonomy.
